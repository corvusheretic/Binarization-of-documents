# Binarization-of-documents
This is the implementation for DIBCO binarization competetion in 2014. It improves over N.Howe's binarization algorithm

THe main file to run is 
  demoHTR.m
This file requires paths to the DIBCO images along with the outputs to compute the scores
All the mex compilations should be done automatically in the imgcut.m file.
However setting the compilers required for the mex interface is discussed best on the Matlab homepage.
